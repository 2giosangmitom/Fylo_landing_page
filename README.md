# Fylo Dark Theme Landing Page - Frontend Mentor Solution

This is my solution for the Fylo Dark Theme Landing Page challenge on Frontend Mentor, built using Nuxt.js 3.

This project is a solution to the [Fylo Dark Theme Landing Page challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-dark-theme-landing-page-5ca5f2d21e82137ec91a50fd) on Frontend Mentor. The challenge was to build a landing page for a file storage service with a dark theme. The solution is responsive and built using Nuxt.js 3, a progressive Vue.js framework.
